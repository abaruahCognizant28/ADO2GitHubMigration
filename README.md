# ADO2GitHubMigration
A tool that helps migrate repo from Azure DevOps to GitHub. The assumption is CI/CD pipeline stays in Azure DevOps.


1. Executive Summary

The tool objective is to migrate repositories from Azure DevOps git to GitHub repo. Repository will be migrated and maintaining the complete commit history and permissions. One will continue to leverage its established Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline .

2. Objectives

-	Source Code & History Preservation: Migrate all repositories with full Git history (branches, tags, commits).
-	CI/CD Integration: Maintain the existing Azure DevOps pipeline, ensuring minimal disruption.
-	Permissions Migration: Map and transfer existing repository-level and branch-level permissions (leveraging AD groups to GitHub Teams).
-	Automated Validation: Implement post-migration readiness checks for repository integrity and user access.
-	End-to-End Automation: Develop an orchestration script/AI agent to manage tasks from retrieval to validation.

3. Migration Strategy
3.1 Repository Migration & History Preservation

-	Clone Repository: Use `git clone --mirror` to copy the full repository, preserving all branches, tags, and history.
-	Push to GitHub: Use `git push --mirror` to transfer the entire commit tree to GitHub Enterprise.
-	Verify: After pushing, run scripts to check commit counts, branches, and tags to ensure no history was lost.

3.2 CI/CD Pipeline Integration
-	Existing Pipelines: Continue utilizing the Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines.
-	Remote Repository URL Update: Modify the service connections in Azure DevOps to direct to the new GitHub Enterprise remote repository while maintaining existing pipeline definitions.
-	Webhooks & Triggers: Ensure that GitHub Enterprise repositories trigger builds in Azure DevOps, thus preserving the automated build and deployment processes.
3.3 Permissions & Access Migration
-	Mapping Groups: Align existing Azure DevOps permissions/groups with GitHub Teams. As user authentication is via Active Directory, leverage GitHub Enterprise’s SAML/SSO integration for a seamless transition.
-	Automated Permissions Script: Develop scripts to extract current permission settings from Azure DevOps, translate these settings to GitHub’s access levels (e.g., repo admin, write, read), and use GitHub’s API to assign users to appropriate teams.
-	Validation: Conduct automated checks post-migration to ensure each user’s access rights are consistent with their previous permissions.
3.4 Automated Readiness & Validation Checks
-	Repository Health Checks: Create an automation script (or AI agent component) that verifies:
-	The integrity of the repository (commit counts, tags, branches).
-	Correct CI/CD pipeline integration (trigger tests by simulating code push).
-	Access Verification: Automate tests to simulate AD-authenticated user logins, verifying user access aligns with migrated permissions.
-	Logs & Alerts: Configure the system to generate comprehensive logs and alert the DevOps team if discrepancies or failures occur.
4. Proposed End-to-End Automated Process
4.1 Automation Orchestration
-	Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis
-	Inventory the repository (branches, tags, permissions).
-	Map users/groups from Azure DevOps to GitHub Teams.
-	Step 2: Repository Migration
-	Execute mirror clone and push commands.
-	Automatically update the remote URL within Azure DevOps CI/CD definitions.
-	Step 3: Permissions Migration
-	Invoke the API-driven script to assign permissions in GitHub Enterprise.
-	Step 4: Integration with Existing Pipelines
-	Reconfigure CI/CD pipelines to point to the migrated repository.
-	Step 5: Automated Post-Migration Validation
-	Run tests to validate repository integrity and user access.
-	An AI agent (if deployed) will monitor logs, detect anomalies, and suggest remedial actions for identified issues.
-	Step 6: Notification & Rollout
-	Notify stakeholders once validations pass, indicating readiness for production use.
5. Risk Analysis & Mitigation
-	Data Loss: Mitigate by validating commit histories, performing backups, and using mirror pushes.
-	CI/CD Downtime: Ensure proper redirection of pipeline triggers and test changes in a staging environment.
-	Permissions Mismatch: Utilize detailed mapping scripts and perform thorough automated testing on each repository.
-	Automation Failure: Include rollback procedures and manual checkpoints before finalizing each migration.
